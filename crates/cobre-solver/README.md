# cobre-solver

LP/MIP solver abstraction for the [Cobre](https://github.com/cobre-rs/cobre) power systems ecosystem.

Provides a backend-agnostic solver interface with a default HiGHS backend, designed for the LP subproblems in SDDP and other power system optimization algorithms.

## Status

**Experimental** — this is a name reservation. The first functional release will be `0.1.0`.

See the [main repository](https://github.com/cobre-rs/cobre) for the full roadmap.
