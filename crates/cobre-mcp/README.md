# cobre-mcp

Model Context Protocol (MCP) server for the [Cobre](https://github.com/cobre-rs/cobre) power systems solver.

Exposes Cobre operations as MCP tools, data artifacts as resources, and guided workflows as prompts. Enables AI coding assistants and automation agents to interact with Cobre without parsing CLI text output.

## Status

**Experimental** — this is a name reservation. The first functional release will be `0.1.0`.

See the [main repository](https://github.com/cobre-rs/cobre) for the full roadmap.
