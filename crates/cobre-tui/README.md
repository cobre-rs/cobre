Provides real-time SDDP training monitoring, convergence visualization, cut inspection, and simulation progress tracking using `ratatui` and `crossterm`. Consumed by `cobre-cli`; also usable standalone via stdin JSON-lines pipe.

## Status

**Experimental** — this is a name reservation. The first functional release will be `0.1.0`.
